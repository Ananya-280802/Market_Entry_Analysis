# Market_Entry_Analysis
The Chinese dataset consisted of nformation from the people in Shanghai. It gives you information about customer traits within the Chinese market. My job was to create a binomial classification model using the Chinese data set that predicts whether a person is likely to buy a new phone based on the given attributes.Since it was informed that the Chinese and Indian markets are quite similar, I used the model built on Chinese sample data to estimate the customer base in the Indian dataset after making the necessary changes. Unfortunately I could not upload the chinese dataset due to space contraints.
